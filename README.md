This is my B.Tech final year project.
This project is designed to get the fatial expression and detect the objects.
It uses ml5.js library features for ML and electron.js for creation of desktop application.

It has a chatbot module, so run it and enjoy!

To **run**: 
``` bash
npm i
npm start
```
To **build** windows application:

```
